# test_a_perceptual_phenomenon
## Project Overview
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.

- For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
- In this project, a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect) is investigated. You will learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task yourself. You will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, you will interpret your results in terms of your hypotheses.

- This project will review the basic concepts of statistics, including:
  - How to identify components of an experiment
  - How to use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample
  - How to set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results
